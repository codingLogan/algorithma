## Cracking the Coding Interview

This repository is being used to track the chapters and exercises that are presented in _Cracking the Coding Interview_. The hope is they would be helpful in interview preparations, or reviewing various data structures and implementations.

Check for folders named `ch#` for chapters, and inside you'll find exercises named `#.#_*` that match the exercises.
